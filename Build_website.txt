To build a website that facilitates the hiring of drones with operators for various agricultural and mapping activities, as well as the sale of non-commercial mini drones, you would need a database schema to store and manage the relevant information. Here's a suggested database schema for your project:

Users Table:
user_id (Primary Key)
username
password
email
phone
address
role (customer, operator, admin)

Drones Table:
drone_id (Primary Key)
drone_name
description
drone_type
hourly_rate
availability_status
operator_id (Foreign Key referencing Operators Table)
is_available_for_sale

Operators Table:
operator_id (Primary Key)
operator_name
operator_phone
operator_email
operator_rating

Activities Table:
activity_id (Primary Key)
activity_name
Drone_Activities Table (Many-to-Many relationship between Drones and Activities):
drone_id (Foreign Key referencing Drones Table)
activity_id (Foreign Key referencing Activities Table)

Orders Table:
order_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users Table)
drone_id (Foreign Key referencing Drones Table)
start_date
end_date
total_cost
order_status

Mini_Drones Table:
mini_drone_id (Primary Key)
mini_drone_name
mini_drone_description
mini_drone_price
is_available_for_sale
With this schema, you can store user information, details of available drones and operators, supported activities, orders placed by customers, and information about mini drones for sale. The tables are related to each other using foreign keys to establish relationships and ensure data integrity.

Remember that this is just a basic schema to get you started. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, you may need to modify or extend the schema.
